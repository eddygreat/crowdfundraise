# crowdfundraise
this is a basic app for crowd funding. 
for the first time you can run npx hardhat
then run npx hardhat compile to compile the project
run npx thirdweb@latest deploy, to deploy the app on third web.
ensure your thirdweb is connected to a wallet e.g metamask wallet.
ensure you have matic to account for gas fees
ensure you give the contract enough time for others to participate.
test as much as possible.
enjoy
